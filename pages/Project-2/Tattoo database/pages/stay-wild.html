I had all this money that my parents had given me because I was abroad so I spent it on a tattoo.
 <br>Does this tattoo have a meaning behind it? - I wrote it a lot in sketch book and I’m into extreme sports like snowboarding and skating. <br>Is it your own artwork? - It’s inspired by other typefaces, but worked it out in own style.
