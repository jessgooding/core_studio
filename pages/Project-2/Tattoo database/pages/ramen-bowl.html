Maximin (@vcmttt)<br>How long did it take? - 45 minutes.<br>How impulsive was it? - Considered it for two months. <br>Does this tattoo have a meaning behind it? - I am deathly allergic to peanuts and have been hospitalized several times as a result. For every food that nearly kills me I said I would get a tattoo inspired by it. I got a bowl of noodles and it was topped with peanuts.
<br>Is it your own artwork? - I drew this inspired by another tattoo I've seen. The noodles were spruced up by the artist but I added the egg.
