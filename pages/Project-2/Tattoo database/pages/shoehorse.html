   <br>Does this tattoo have a meaning behind it? - The shoe horse with the horizon setting on the desert between it represents the time I spent in the Wyoming as a child and my fondness for life in the mid-west.
 <br>Is it your own artwork? - No I live in fucking New York City, the Mecca of tattooing. There’s no way I would think I would know better than some of the best tattoo artist out there.
