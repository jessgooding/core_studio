I think about each tattoo for at least a year before I get them. <br>Does this tattoo have a meaning behind it? - Secret world is an album by Peter Gabriel. My dad and I watched the live concert movie all the time when I was little and it’s the album that is closest to my heart. An alternate meaning is that we all have a personal secret world that no one else knows.<br>Is it your own artwork? - Art is by the tattoo artists.
